AWS API Gateway
* Create new API endpoint /invoicecreated
* Create new API endpoint /invoicepaid

AWS Lambda
1) Wire API /invoicecreated  to lambda function CreateNewInvoice()
         This will create a new entry in SQS queue "NewInvoice" and return HTTP OK
2) Wire API /invoicepaid to lambda function CreatePaidInvoice()
           This will create a new entry in SQS queue "PaidInvoice" and return HTTP OK
3) Create a lambda function InvoiceProcessor() that is triggered on new SQS entry.
           This will process both queues
      A) NewInvoice Queue:
             Pull details from Stripe, Subscription details for the invoice
             Check if credit entry is in QB, if not, add the entry with all info from stripe
              Delete the message
      B) PaidInvoice Queue:
              Pull details from Stripe, Subscription details for the invoice
             Check if credit entry is in QB, if not, add the entry with all info from stripe
              Delete the message

SQS Setup
   2 Queues:
       A) "NewInvoice"
       B)  "PaidInvoice"
